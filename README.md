Ian Brown PCA 2026 Essay

	Over the past year in preparation for my next foray into the PCA I decided to pursue my interest in coding through what could best be described as immersion therapy. I wanted to see as much as I reasonably could regardless of language or end goal. The main content I would take in were game development streams in C++, as well as smaller projects using Javascript. I’ve also been enjoying smaller youtube videos of people working on projects that caught my interest. Similarly, I started gathering resources for my own small knowledgebase of information I could use as reference one, one that has been particularly helpful being the MIT Intro to Programming and Computer Science course that they offer for free online. 
	One thing that stuck with me from the interview process last year was some advice I got from Jenny that was ‘make it first, make it good later’. I’ve heard it many times since then but it was still something I wanted to take to heart and in my learning I also started trying to teach myself Python by making a visual novel in the program Ren’Py. It’s definitely not good but it has been a lot of fun just trying to put something together. I also have started messing around with a small website that lets me track the Scale Models I like to build, just as something to keep track but also display for my own amusement.
	Professionally one of my goals this past year was to be more proactive in seeking out available information and resources that are available. One of my biggest road blocks has frequently been not wanting or thinking I should be asking for help because it would make me look silly or worry that in asking I would be perceived as unknowledgeable when in reality it’s definitely the opposite. Whether I think I should know it is irrelevant if I can’t recall it or just in fact don’t know it and not asking only prevents me from knowing it in the future. Being able to, for lack of better words, humble myself into asking for help has been tough but immensely helpful and unsurprising has helped me many times over just in the past year. I think that professionally that puts me in a good position to open myself to learning new things and then help me understand more of the underlying conditions involved instead of surface level if X then Y, it’s Y because of Z. 
	Coincidentally I think that opening myself to asking more questions around the office has helped me in my personal life just being able to be more talkative in groups of people I’m unfamiliar with, which has also been a struggle of mine for as long as I can think. I open up eventually but it usually takes me a while, but recently I’ve noticed it takes a lot less time than it had before.

Some things I’ve used this year:

Intro to CompSci and Programming in Python

Code Wars

Egghead.io

The Odin Project


Some fun things that helped me in downtime:

The Farmer is Replaced

Ren’Py Visual Novel Engine

Various Pokemon RomHack development streams
