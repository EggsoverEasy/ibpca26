            <h3>Ian Brown</h3>
            <h1>Web Developer</h1>
            <span>To be</span>
            <p>Ian is a passionate, life long learner that is eager to embark on the next great chapter of his life.</p>
            <p>Ian was born in Maryland, but moved to and grew up in Delaware from when he was five years old. He graduated from the University of Delaware in 2011 with a Bachelor of the Arts in the Fine Art program.</p>
            <p>As someone who grew up with the internet, Ian's love of programming started small and familiar for a lot of his peers- on an up and coming website called Neopets™ that let you take basic HTML to your storefront and make it yours. This would later transition to MySpace™ making profile pages for people now using CSS.</p>
            <p>As an adult, and still looking to do more, Ian went back to school and got an Associates in Computer Science at Del Tech University before ultimately landing at <span class="PHRG" title="I work here!">Power Home Remodeling Group</span> and joined their <span class="PHRG" title="This is my job!">Ninja Support Team</span> with the driving light of one day joining the PCA.</p>
